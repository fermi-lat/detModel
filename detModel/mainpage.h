/*! \mainpage package detModel

 This package provides an interface to a generic detector description
 or model suitable for use by an application such as Simulation 
 or Reconstruction.  
 <p>Currently, the source of the model is an xml file, such as flight.xml,
 which describes a particular detector according to the document type
 description in ggd.dtd, but clients of <strong>detModel</strong>
 are insulated from  the xml source.
